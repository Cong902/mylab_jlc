I am a faculty member of the Department of Psychology in Qingdao University. I got my Doctoral degree at South China Normal University. During the period of doctoral study, I worked for one year at The Pennsylvania State University as a Visiting Research student. My recent research interests include the cognitive and neural mechanisms of bilingual language switching and the foreign language effect on social decision.
