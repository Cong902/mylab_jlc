I am a faculty member of the Department of Psychology in Qingdao University. I got my Doctoral degree at Beijing Normal University. During the period of doctoral study, I worked for one year at University of Pittsburgh as a Visiting Research student. My recent research interests include the cognitive and neural mechanisms of  language learning and the interactions between bilingualism and domain-general cognitive control.
