abstract: By combining EEG and immersive virtual reality (iVR) technologies, the current study compared novel word learning in an iVR environment and through picture-word (PW) association. During three days of learning sessions, Chinese speakers learned two sets of German words, one set using iVR and the other set through PW association. A recognition task was administered to measure immediate (Day 4) and delayed learning performance (two weeks later). The results of the immediate post-test showed that compared to PW-learned words, there was better behavioral performance on iVR-learned words, along with increased N200 and decreased LPC amplitude. Time-frequency representation analyses further revealed reduced μ power for iVR-learned words relative to PW-learned words. However, the benefits of iVR-learned words did not emerge in the delayed post-test. These findings align with the social second language learning perspective and cognitive theory of multimedia learning, contributing to a deeper understanding of how multimodal learning environments influence word acquisition.
